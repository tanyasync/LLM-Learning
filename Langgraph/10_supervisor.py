"""
A sequential line is fixed: research, then write, then edit -- always in that order.
But what if the work needs judgement? "Is this a billing question or a tech
question? Who should handle it?" That's the SUPERVISOR pattern:

                 +-------------+
        +------> | supervisor  | <------+     the supervisor READS the state and
        |        +------+------+        |     DECIDES which worker goes next; the
        v               |              v      worker does its bit and reports back;
    [billing]        [tech]        [general]  the supervisor decides again... until
                                              it says FINISH.

The mechanic is Day 24's `add_conditional_edges`: the supervisor node writes a
"next" decision into state, and a router function sends the graph to that worker.
After every worker we route BACK to the supervisor -- that back-edge is what makes
it a hierarchy (a boss in the loop) instead of a straight line.

Run it (needs a free GROQ_API_KEY in a .env file next to this script):
    python supervisor.py
